#### A MS-DOS pseudo-3D space shoot 'em up made in SNES mode7 developed with DIV Game Studio 2 'vanilla' (the original MS-DOS version from 1998).

Initially this project was an entry for an internal one-month length Game Jam with some colleagues, a bunch of veteran and known Spanish developers from this game engine in their days.

My intention is continue the development of this game in my spare time, with calm now, and complete it to publish in my [itch.io](https://ex3.itch.io/) and [GameJolt](http://portfolio.visualstudioex3.com/) profiles, in downloable version with embebed [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/), and, if is possible, also in HTML5 version (using [HTML5 DOSBox version](https://github.com/dreamlayers/em-dosbox), the same used in [Internet Archive MS-DOS Games library](https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_msdos_games?tab=collection)).

This project uses 3D Assets from **Unity Asset Store**, rendered to 2D frames using a custom Unity tool (not included yet in this repository).
